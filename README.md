# Bank Marketing & Term Deposit Prediction Analysis 
This project focuses on analyzing data from direct marketing campaigns by a Portuguese banking institution, where phone calls were made to clients in order to determine if they would subscribe to a bank term deposit. The goal is to identify which features have the most impact on predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (*yes*) or not (*no*). By exploring the relationship between various client characteristics and their likelihood of subscription, this analysis aims to provide insights into the key drivers behind successful marketing outcomes. 

_You can access the dataset via the following link: [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing). Keep in mind, for this project, I used **bank-full.csv**, processed it roughly in Power Query, and renamed as bank.csv before going into this analysis._

## Asking Questions
  
* What are the correlations between the attributes?
* Is there a specific job type more likely to subscribe to a term deposit?
* What range of average balances is most associated with people subscribing to a term deposit?
* How do the attributes "credit in default" (`default`), "housing loan" (`housing`), and "personal loan" (`loan`) individually, or in combination, affect the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit?
